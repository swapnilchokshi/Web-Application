# FoodForGood (FFG)
In today’s world of high inflation rate and stunted economy, their now still millions of people over the world, who cannot afford 2 meals in a day.

The website that we are creating will provide a platform for people having surplus (left-over) food to be distributed to needy people through help of our website or an application. In every Indian homes, restaurants, or events – each day sufficient amount of food is being left-over and gets wasted by throwing it in the garbage. This healthy meal can satisfy hunger of poor person who’s been a victim of the advanced world.

Through our software, people can contact to our organization or other related NGOs depending on the nearest location or city, which will distribute the food to less fortunate sections of society in cities and towns. The lesser fortunate sections who the organization will be reaching out to includes homeless families, orphanages, night shelters, homes for abandoned children, patients from public hospitals, etc.
